# Cloud Robotics Resources

## Foreword

Cloud Robotics is any use of cloud technologies to support robotics applications. This includes, but is not limited to: cloud computing; cloud storage; cloud-based OTA deployments; simulation; and global connectivity. In short, any use of the cloud by robots, direct, or indirect, is classed as Cloud Robotics.

However, Cloud Robotics is a young field that comes with a lot of issues. Our own State of Cloud Robotics survey shows that a lot of the problems with Cloud Robotics is in lack of documentation and useful examples. That is to say, while users would benefit from more and better Cloud Robotics tools, the greatest need at the moment is instructions and best practices for using the tools that already exist.

This in turn leads to our Resources section, where we are curating useful Cloud Robotics tools into one place. More than this, we are organising these tools into best practices to help new users get started with the right technologies, used in the right way. Are you looking to connect your robot to the cloud in the easiest way possible, or offload data as quickly as you can? This page should show you how.

:::tip
This page is a living document, and will be updated over time as new tools come out and we receive new suggestions. If you have a resource that you want to tell the community about, or any other suggestion to make for this page, please [create an issue](https://github.com/cloudroboticshub/cloudroboticshub.github.io/issues/new) and one of the group will review the suggestion. If it is accepted, we will happily add it to the page!

<!-- TODO: I don't know anything. How do I get started? -->

## Getting Started

- [Fog Robotics](https://sites.google.com/view/fogrobotics) Utilize storage, compute, and networking resources between cloud and edge in a federated manner. From UC Berkeley.
  - [FogROS 2](https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/FogROS2/about) An Adaptive and Extensible Platform for Cloud and Fog Robotics Using ROS 2. [Code](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/FogROS2) 
- [International Conference on Cloud and Robotics](https://www.cloudrobotics.info/) Ongoing academic conference series on cloud and robotics topics. Proceedings are not available at this site.
- [CloudGripper: The Open Source Cloud Robotics Testbed](https://cloudgripper.org) Open source cloud robotics testbed for remote robotic manipulation research, benchmarking, and data collection. From KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

## Web Tools

- [Robot Web Tools](https://robotwebtools.github.io/) Open-source libraries and tools for building web-based robot apps with ROS.

## Other collections

Some of these may not be maintained anymore.
