[Fog Robotics](https://sites.google.com/view/fogrobotics) allows users to utilize storage, compute, and networking resources between cloud and edge in a federated manner.

Fog Robotics is developed by members of UC Berkeley.

[FogROS 2](https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/FogROS2/about) is also developed by UC Berkeley as part of Fog Robotics. It is an adaptive and extensible platform for Cloud and Fog Robotics using ROS2.

[FogROS2 SGC](https://github.com/data-capsule/fogros2-sgc) is an extension of FogROS 2 which connects disjoint ROS2 networks across different physical locations, networks, and Data Distribution Services.
