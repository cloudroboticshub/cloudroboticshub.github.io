[Transitive](https://transitiverobotics.com/) is an open-source framework for full-stack robotics. It is designed to make it easy to create capabilities that seamlessly connect robot, cloud, and web front-ends including a dynamically updating shared data model. It offers solutions to many problems developers encounter when building full-stack robotic applications, including unreliable networks, robots that are regularly offline or turned off, as well as cross-device version dependencies.
