## [AWS IoT Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)

AWS IoT Greengrass is an open-source edge runtime and cloud service for building, deploying, and managing device software. It also provides easier interfacing with some AWS services, such as Amazon Lambda, and allows for global communication over MQTT via AWS IoT Core.

Greengrass is not built specifically for robots, but can be used by any robot with enough system resources for Greengrass, which is a memory-intensive management application.
