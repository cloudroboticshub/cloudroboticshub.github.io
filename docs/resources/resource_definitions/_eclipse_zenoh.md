## [Eclipse Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/)

Zenoh is a pub/sub/query protocol that also allows for distributed storage, queries, and computation. It claims efficiency well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

In addition to the protocol, Zenoh is building [rmw_zenoh](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_zenoh), a ROS Middleware (RMW) implementation that can be used as a replacement for ROS2 DDS. This allows robots to communicate across the globe using cloud-based routers while providing all of the features available in Zenoh.
