# Foreword

Cloud Robotics is any use of cloud technologies to support robotics applications. This includes, but is not limited to: cloud computing; cloud storage; cloud-based OTA deployments; simulation; and global connectivity. In short, any use of the cloud by robots, direct, or indirect, is classed as Cloud Robotics. You can read more about why to use Cloud Robotics in [this blog post](https://mikelikesrobots.github.io/blog/why-use-cloud-robotics) by one of our members.

However, Cloud Robotics is a young field that has growing pains. Our own [State of Cloud Robotics survey](/survey) shows that the most common problems developers have with Cloud Robotics is in lack of documentation and useful examples. That is to say, while users would benefit from more and better Cloud Robotics tools, the greatest need at the moment is instructions and best practices for using the tools that already exist.

This in turn leads to our Resources section, where we are curating useful Cloud Robotics tools into one place. More than this, we are recommending best practices to help new users get started with the right technologies, used in the right way. If you are looking to connect your robot to the cloud in the easiest way possible, or offload data as quickly as possible, this page should show you how.

:::tip
This page is a living document, and will be updated over time as new tools come out and we receive new suggestions. If you have a resource that you want to tell the community about, or any other suggestion to make for this page, please [create an issue](https://github.com/cloudroboticshub/cloudroboticshub.github.io/issues/new) and one of the group will review the suggestion. If it is accepted, we will happily add it to the page!
