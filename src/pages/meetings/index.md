## 2026-02-11: Canonical Observability Stack Tryout (Cancelled)

~~Following the previous meeting's presentation on the Canonical Observability~~
~~Stack, the group will attempt to deploy some components based on the publicly~~
~~available tutorials and documentation. This is similar to previous meetings~~
~~where the group tried out KubeEdge and Zenoh.~~

## 2026-01-28: Canonical Observability Stack with Guillaume Beuzeboc

For this session, the CRWG invited [Guillaume
Beuzeboc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-beuzeboc/) from
[Canonical](https://canonical.com/) to present on the [Canonical Observability
Stack
(COS)](https://canonical-robotics.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanations/observability/what-is-cos-for-robotics/).
COS is a general observability stack for devices such as drones, robots, and IoT
devices. It operates from telemetry data, and the COS team has extended it to
support robot-specific use cases. Guillaume, a software engineer at Canonical,
previously presented COS at ROSCon 2025 and kindly agreed to join this
meeting to discuss additional technical details with the CRWG. 

The talk also includes questions from the group members, such as how non-experts
can operate the tool, and whether it supports conditional deployment based on
robot capabilities.

## 2026-01-14: ROSCon Review Continued

In this meeting, the group reviewed the list of ROSCon talks collected from the
previous session. They reviewed the talks most likely to be relevant to Logging
& Observability by looking through the extra information and transcripts from
the talks. The group also made a few points about the talks that will be
summarised in an upcoming blog post.

## 2025-12-31: No Meeting

The group agreed to skip this meeting as it is the holiday period for many
members.

## 2025-12-17: Cancelled Meeting

The group met in this session, but given the few members available, decided to
postpone the meeting until the new year.

## 2025-12-03: No Session

The group will be skipping this session as some members are unavailable.

## 2025-11-19: ROSCon Review

In this meeting, the group looked at the talks listed for ROSCon, examining the
description of each for any that would be relevant to Logging & Observability,
the current focus of the group. Next session will dive deeper into the talks to
pull out interesting tips for a blog post.

## 2025-11-05: General Catch-Up

The CRWG used this meeting to have a general catch-up. They answered some
questions about the use of cloud to view remote video data, and discussed the
past few sessions. The group also decided to have a ROSCon review session.

## 2025-10-22: INSAION with Sergi Grau-Moya and Victor Massagué Respall

In this meeting, [Sergi
Grau-Moya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergi-grau-moya-310749158/), Co-founder
and CEO of [INSAION](https://www.insaion.com/), and [Victor Massagué
Respall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergi-grau-moya-310749158/), Co-founder and
CTO of INSAION, presented the INSAION platform to the group. This platform is an
observability platform for your robot fleet, allowing users to optimise robot
operations and explore advanced robot diagnostics. It also has some very
impressive visualisations!

The group then had time to ask follow-up questions, including what big takeaways
INSAION had from customer conversations, and how to maintain a log of previous
resolutions to apply to future issues.

## 2025-10-08: AMP with Carter Schultz

In this meeting, [Carter
Schultz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carter-builds-robots/) of
[AMP](https://ampsortation.com/) came to discuss how the company manages large
deployments and the pain points they see from doing so.

This was a fascinating talk and highlighted a lot of issues that AMP had to
hand-build solutions for. Carter also spoke about how many of the newer tools
available on the market now do not fit well into their architecture, which makes
them less enticing to adopt.

Some key takeaways for the group included:

- Don't put metrics in logs! If you need state, put it on a topic, then egress
  through the topic. Logs should always serve a purpose.
- Build alerts with an action that can resolve them. Operations managers will
  start to ignore red alerts if there's never something they can do to resolve
  them.

The CRWG had a lot of questions about the talk afterwards, such as whether newer
technologies would be useful if AMP was starting up now, and how AMP manages
redundant data uploads.

## 2025-09-24: ROSBag MCP Server Research Presentation

In this meeting, guest speakers [Lei Fu](https:www.linkedin.com/in/leifu6968) and [Sahar
Slimpour](https:www.linkedin.com/in/saharsalimpour), from the Zurich University
of Applied Sciences and University of Turku respectively, joined the CRWG to
talk about their ROSBag MCP Server research (also shared in [ROS
Discourse](https://discourse.openrobotics.org/t/another-mcp-server-to-analyze-your-rosbags-with-llms-a-ui-to-benchmark-it-against-different-llm-providers/49897)).

The speakers discussed comparing different LLM models for analysing and
reporting on recorded robot data. Due to how large robot datasets are, they
often exceed LLM context limits, which makes the work challenging. To help, the
speakers built a tool called MCP Lab which helped show different stats about LLM
responses, such as time taken, tokens used, and so on.

The speakers also showed a live demo, where different LLM models could be
selected to summarise robot performance or perform more complex tasks, like
identifying if any objects came closer than a fixed distance over the dataset.

Finally, the CRWG asked questions about the research, such as how to trust
answers from the LLM when it was occasionally wrong, and possible future
features for the MCP Lab.

## 2025-09-08: Summer Holiday

The group will not meet on this date, due to the number of members unable to
attend. Meetings will resume from the 22nd September.

## 2025-08-25: Logging & Observability Review

In this meeting, the CRWG discussed the similarities and differences between the
tech of the companies that had come to talk about Logging & Observability. The
group agreed that we need to talk to consumers of these technologies, so effort
will be made to contact some of the companies with large fleets to request they
talk to us. We can also release a summary of our findings so far to ask the
community if they approve of the direction taken and the information gathered.

## 2025-08-11: Arun Venkatadri and Shouheng Yi present Bagel

In this meeting, guest speakers
[Arun Venkatadri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunvenkatadri/) and
[Shouheng Yi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shouhengyi/) presented
a new open source project called [Bagel](https://github.com/shouhengyi/bagel).
_While both speakers are key members of
[Model-Prime](https://www.model-prime.com/), the Bagel project is not affiliated
with Model-Prime._

Bagel lets you chat with your robotics data by using AI to search through
recorded data. This is particularly relevant given the group has recently been
researching Logging & Observability in preparation to write a community guide on
the same subject.

Our guests spoke about the motivation behind the project before showing a
technical demo, then answering questions from the group. In particular, we were
interested in the pitfalls of using LLMs to understand structured data, and went
into depth on this point. Arun has stated that the conversation inspired
progress on the project and hopes to return in a future session to show a
solution.

## 2025-07-28: Trying Out Heex and Discussing Anomaly Detection

In this meeting, the group signed up for an account on the [Heex Technologies
website](https://www.heex.io/) to test out the services provided. We read
through the different features of the service, including creating a new robot,
then worked through the accompanying documentation to generate fake high
velocity events. The group then visualised the events with the service, learning
more about how the triggers worked in the process.

## 2025-07-14: Guest Expert Bruno Mendes De Silva from Heex Technologies

The group invited [Bruno Mendes De
Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunomendesdasilva/) to join us at this
meeting as a guest expert in Logging and Observability.

Bruno is the Co-Founder and CEO of [Heex Technologies](https://www.heex.io/),
which is a cloud data platform accelerating Physical AI adoption. The company
helps customers with their autonomous systems by collecting and presenting only
the most relevant data for a required view.

Bruno and Benoit Hozjan, who is a Project Manager in charge of customer
experience, presented Heex Technologies together. First they discussed the
company and the purpose of the service, then they demonstrated a showcase
workspace for the visualisation and anomaly detection capabilities.

## 2025-06-30: Logging & Observability Discussion ~~(Upcoming)~~ **CANCELLED**

This meeting is cancelled as the host is unwell. Meetings will resume as normal
from the 14th July.

Previous text:

_In the upcoming session, the group plans to go over the research performed to
this date. This includes the first preparation session and the previous session,
where we hosted a discussion with Benji Barash, Co-Founder and CEO of Roboto.AI._

_This will be a quieter, more relaxed session, as some of the members are unable
to attend._

## 2025-06-16: Guest Expert Benji Barash from Roboto AI

The group invited guest expert Benji Barash, Co-Founder and CEO at Roboto AI, to
discuss Logging & Observability.

Benji leads Roboto AI, which provides an analytics engine for physical AI. The
company focuses on searching, transforming, and analyzing data from robots at
scale. Previously, Benji led engineering and science teams at Amazon Robotics,
with a focus on simulation and autonomy.

The meeting became more of a presentation and Q&A, as Benji had slides and demos
ready to run. He showed very impressive tech from Roboto.AI, including the
ability to select a clip of robot data and search other datasets for similar
clips to find similar motions!

The full meeting recording is available below.

## 2025-06-02: Logging and Observability Preparation

The group met to start researching Logging & Observability, with the intention
of gathering information for a community guide on the subject. Collectively,
they gathered the following points to consider going forwards:

- **Format for recording logs and data**: structured data? Unstructured? Strings? JSON? Rosbags?
- **Online vs offline data upload**: collecting data offline for uploading later
- **Automatic incident detection**: is data collection constant, or triggered by
  a specific event, or possibly by a developer?
- **Message publishing frequency**: a slower message publishing frequency often
  indicates a system issue.
- **Cause of Issue**: determining the cause of the issue, if there is one.
- **Publishing Protocol**: MQTT, ROS2 topics, HTTP, or other. Advantages and
  disadvantages of each method.
- **On demand vs constant logging**
- **Interfacing with observability tools**: publishing or formatting data to be
  compatible with observability tools such as Prometheus
- **Live visualisation tools**: pros and cons of different tools such as RViz
  and Foxglove. For example, Foxglove can provide a web link, which is easier to
  share to other team members.
- **Levels of data upload**: minimal upload such as basic logs; rosbags with
  debug data; developer-triggered upload of all robot information.
- **Custom downsampling**: topics can be downsampled depending on the quantity
  of data and the bandwidth available. Another option is to extract important
  information, such as the closest lidar point or the classes recognised from
  the camera, to reduce the data uploaded.
- **Target user of data**: who will make use of the data? This affects how the
  data is presented and used.

The group ended by discussing potential guest experts that could help provide
information and insights for the guide.

## 2025-05-19: Ideas for Cloud Robotics Guides

The group met and used this time to discuss possible guides for publishing on
Cloud Robotics Hub. This would make our expertise available to the
public in an easily digestible format.

As part of the meeting, we agreed to post a poll to the community to get a
better idea of priority on each suggested topic. The results are in [this blog post](/blog/community-guide-priorities).

## 2025-05-05: Continued Discussion: Uploading Robot Data to the Cloud

In this meeting, the group met to continue their discussion about uploading
robot data to the cloud. They expanded from the previous discussion to include
more important details about the data being uploaded, such as the moment it was
captured versus an incident, to give one example.

The group also discussed difficulties with cloud data collection, such as the
difficulty of automatic anomaly detection, and how companies frequently have to
build their own data collection solution to meet their needs.

## 2025-04-07: Discussion: Uploading Robot Data to the Cloud

The group used this meeting to discuss uploading robot data to the cloud.
Together, they worked through the most useful information to convey to robotics
developers, resulting in the start of a [Google
Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kLqeBrKg0FgD0z2LoAgwufu_LryPktxgxVUlHmDsJII/edit?usp=drive_link)
to organise the most important data by category of robotics.

The group finished by agreeing to continue the discussion in the following
session.

## 2025-03-24: General Catch-Up

In this shorter session, two members met and discussed the use of LLMs in
robotic and software development, then agreed on a new format that could be used
in future sessions: proposing a discussion topic in advance and using the
session to discuss that topic.

Based on this agreement, a new [Github
Issue](https://github.com/cloudroboticshub/cloudroboticshub.github.io/issues/33)
can be used to propose discussion topics for future meetings. Anyone can post to
the issue and join in the discussion.

## 2025-02-24: Robot Deployment Discussion

In this session, the group discussed their preferences and issues with the most
popular deployment methods. The group agreed that distribution via Docker
containers was the best method, but still had issues, such as the large download
sizes of images. Later in the session, the group also discussed a possible
project to remotely disable particular functions of a robot remotely.

## 2025-02-10: Testing KubeEdge (For Real, This Time)

The group had their second meeting to try out KubeEdge, having heard more about
it from [Tomoya Fujita in a guest talk](/blog/tomoya-fujita-kubeedge).

Two of the members had some success with the prerequisites for KubeEdge, but
neither were able to connect a Raspberry Pi to a cloud machine as an edge
device. They were able to get a Kubernetes cluster connecting to another machine
on the same network, treating it as an edge device and seeing ROS 2 traffic
between the two machines.

The group summarised their experience of KubeEdge:

> We found KubeEdge to be conceptually very powerful, and the functionality we
> did get working was very impressive. This looks to be an excellent way to
> manage robots or other edge devices at an enterprise level. However, we did
> have difficulties setting up KubeEdge for a Raspberry Pi at the edge. We think
> the following might be helpful to get others onboarded with KubeEdge:

> 1. It would be great to have a complete reference setup. Set up an EC2
>    instance with an elastic IP, set up the K8s network from scratch, and get a
>    Raspberry Pi (or VM on another machine) to join as an edge device.
> 2. Some instructions in the setup documentation assume prior knowledge. For
>    example, in the KubeEdge example led-raspberrypi, the last step is to
>    change the device Twin attribute, but the instruction does not say how to
>    do so.
> 3. It would be good to have a way of setting up multicast for ROS 2 that
>    doesn't require changes at the cluster admin level to adjust for changes in
>    the ROS 2 network. For example, if the domain ID changes, a new multicast
>    address must be enabled for the cluster, which requires cluster admin
>    rights. The alternative is to configure both the multicast IP address and
>    subscriber IP addresses for each pod, which is more complicated.

## 2025-01-27: Finding KubeEdge Prerequisites

This meeting, the group planned to meet to test out KubeEdge. After the meeting
started, the group realised that there were a number of prerequisites needed to
try KubeEdge, including an active Kubernetes cluster (preferably in the cloud)
and some hardware to deploy to, such as a Raspberry Pi with LED.

The group agreed to set up the prerequisites and attempt the tryout session in
the next session. The group also agreed that for future tryout sessions, they
would read through prerequisites in advance to make sure the meeting can go
ahead.

## 2025-01-13

The group had a general discussion of the latest in robotics news, including
NVIDIA Cosmos, the proliferation of humanoid robotics at present, what cloud
robotics encompasses, and what to do in the next meeting. The group settled on
doing a KubeEdge trial unless a guest speaker is available.

## 2024-12-16 Guest Talk: Robotics Platform empowered by Cloud-Native Technologies (Tomoya Fujita)

In this meeting, we hosted a talk by by [Tomoya Fujita](https://github.com/fujitatomoya),
a software engineer, contributor to ROS2 core, and well-respected community builder.

Tomoya talked about a range of Cloud-Native Technologies he has worked on, and their
relevance to robotics. In particular, Tomoya has done a great deal of work on KubeEdge,
a platform built on Kubernetes that can be used to deploy software to robots as if they
are Kubernetes clusters. Some resources from his talk include:

- [ROSCon 2023: ROS with Kubernetes / KubeEdge](https://roscon.ros.org/2023/talks/ROS_with_KubernetesKubeEdge.pdf)
- [Some examples to deploy ROS / ROS 2 with Kubernetes](https://github.com/fujitatomoya/ros_k8s)
- [Next-generation Robotics Platform for Edge/Cloud](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/colocatedeventsna2024/15/Cilium%2BeBPF-Day-NA_Cilium-with-KubeEdge.v0.pdf)

More information on the talk is available on the [blog post](/blog/tomoya-fujita-kubeedge), including a link to the recording posted on YouTube.

## 2024-11-04 Guest Talk: Eclipse Zenoh and its offering for Cloud Connectivity (Julien Enoch)

The group hosted a talk by [Julien Enoch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienenoch/), a Senior Solutions Architect at [ZettaScale Technology](https://www.zettascale.tech/) and [Eclipse Zenoh](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh) committer.

Julien spoke about the Zenoh protocol, which can run everywhere, from micro-controllers to the Cloud; over TCP, UDP, QUIC, and Websockets. Zenoh provides a software router that can be deployed in any Cloud instance such as AWS EC2, and that can route the protocol between different subsystems. The talk also covered how this is particularly helpful for Connectivity in Cloud Robotics, with a video demonstration of controlling a robot in California from an RViz instance in France!

If you would like to see the talk, which took the whole meeting time, see the recording below.
