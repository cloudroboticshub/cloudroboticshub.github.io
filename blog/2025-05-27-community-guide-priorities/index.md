This is a brief post to announce the results of the community poll to determine priorities of the Cloud Robotics Hub guides.

The polls were posted on:

- ROS Discourse: [Poll Post](https://discourse.ros.org/t/vote-for-the-most-useful-cloud-robotics-guides/43842)
- LinkedIn: [Poll Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-hart-a7614262_vote-for-the-most-useful-cloud-robotics-activity-7330529697442725888-6goD)

After a week of poll time, the results were collected together and combined, assuming that no voter voted in both polls. The results are as follows:

1. Logging and Observability (10 votes)
    - ROS Discourse: 5 votes
    - LinkedIn: 5 votes
1. Simulation on Cloud/Edge (7 votes)
	- ROS Discourse: 2 votes
	- LinkedIn: 5 votes
1. CI/CD/Remote Deployment (7 votes)
	- ROS Discourse: 5 votes
	- LinkedIn: 2 votes
1. Setting up ML in the Cloud (4 votes)
	- ROS Discourse: 2 votes
	- LinkedIn: 2 votes

Therefore, the priority list for the group is now:

-  [Priority 1] Uploading Data to the Cloud (Work In Progress)
-  [Priority 2] Logging and Observability
-  [Priority 3] Simulation on Cloud/Edge
-  [Priority 3] CI/CD/Remote Deployment
-  [Priority 4] Setting up ML in the Cloud

The group will begin to have discussion sessions on each topic to gather information for a guide. We will also consider guests to invite and questions that we need to answer in order to build the guide correctly. With specialist input, we should be able to produce something very valuable for the community.
